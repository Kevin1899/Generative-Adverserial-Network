# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST Dataset
This repository contains code that demonstrates the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten digits resembling the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.

### Overview
This GAN architecture comprises two neural networks - a generator and a discriminator:

__Generator__: 
This network generates fake images that resemble the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

__Discriminator__: This network tries to distinguish between real MNIST images and the fake images generated by the generator.
The GAN architecture is trained in a way that the generator learns to create more realistic images, while the discriminator improves its ability to differentiate between real and fake images.

__Requirements__:

Make sure to install the necessary libraries to run the code:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

NumPy

Matplotlib

SciPy

## Usage

###  Training the GAN

1)To train the GAN model using the MNIST dataset:

2)Ensure the required libraries are installed.

3)Run the provided Python script (gan_mnist.py).

The script will initialize and train the GAN over a defined number of epochs, displaying the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for each epoch.

### Generating Images
After training the GAN model, generate images using the following steps:

1)Run the provided Python script.
2)rained generator model will generate fake MNIST-like images.
3)Images will be saved in the repository with the corresponding epoch number.
